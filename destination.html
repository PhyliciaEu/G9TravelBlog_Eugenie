<h3>Sanfang Qixiang</h3>
<p>With a reputation of “The Historical Source and Cultural Root of Fuzhou”, Sanfang Qixiang (三坊七巷), or called Three Lanes and Seven Alleys, is the most famous historical block of Fuzhou. It is composed of three lanes and seven lanes, hence the name. Traditional fish-bone architectural style is well-kept on over 270 ancient dwellings there, allowing the visitors to have a glimpse of the past. It is also a paradise for snacks, handicrafts and nightlife.</p><br><br><br><br>

<h3>Ancestral Hall and Museum of Lin Zexu</h3>
<p>The Ancestral Hall and Museum of Lin Zexu (林则徐公馆) is located close to Sanfang Qixiang. It was built in memory of Lin Zexu, a national hero in China who famously suppressed the importation of opium and sparked the First Opium War. This ancestral hall and museum will introduce you the entire life of him, with his hand-written poems, couplets, scrolls, political engraving board and other relics exhibited.</p><br><br><br><br>

<h3>Yongquan & Gushan Scenic Area</h3>
<p>“Yong” means “pouring out” and “quan” means “spring” in Chinese. Yongquan Temple (涌泉寺) gets its name because there is a spring pouring out in front of it. Being “One of The Most Sacred Temples in Fujian”, Yongquan Temple is usually a must-visit. The temple is located at the western side of the large Gushan (Drum Mountain) Scenic Area. Visitors heading to Yongquna Temple will also enjoy hiking or biking in Gushan Scenic Area.</p>
